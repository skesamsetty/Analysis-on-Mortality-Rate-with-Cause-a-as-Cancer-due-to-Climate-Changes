**Project Description:** 

In the recent years, we hear a lot about wild fires, droughts, species extinctions, heavy rainfalls, ozone layers. We can clearly observe winters are getting warmer every year.

This project was to done to understand the impact of climate change on the mortality rate with the Cancer as the main cause. 

**Questions:** 

- Does climate change increase mortality rate on nation level?
- Does increasing temperatures lead to higher rates of Cancer?
- How does climate change affect state mortality rate of Cancer?

**Datasets/Resources:**

We are using the datasets from World Health Organization and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

	- Causes of Death in US
			a. Data Owner: U.S. Department of Health & Human Services 
			b. Data Summary: This dataset presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States beginning in 1999. Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia using demographic and medical characteristics. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population.
	
	- Climate Change Data in US
			a. Data Owners: Environmental Data
			b. Data Summary: The Washington Post used the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s Climate Divisional Database (nClimDiv) and Gridded 5km GHCN-Daily climate and Precipitation Dataset (nClimGrid) data sets, which provide monthly climate data between 1895 and 2019 for the Lower 48 states.

**Conclusions:**

Initial conclusion based on our analysis was that increasing temperatures are leading to higher cancer related mortality rates in the US. After looking at some outliers, we started referencing more articles. With recent data, we found so many variables and contradictions. With more time, we would dive deeper into the specifics of mortality related to sun damage. 

From our data, our general conclusions are:
- On a nationwide level, mortality rate through cancer related diseases has been steadily increasing. The sharper increase align with spikes of climate change as well. 
- On a state level, most states mortality rate through cancer related diseases followed a similar pattern to the nationwide level. Steady increase with sharper spikes as climate increases.
- Some states were not supportive of our thesis, like New York. The state had variations of climate change, but a declining mortality rate. There were some spikes around the hottest times, but other than that steadily decreasing.
 
From our data, we can conclude that climate average is increasing on a national level. 
However, it requires more data to determine if is this is directly affecting mortality rate.
